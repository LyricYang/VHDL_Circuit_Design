// This is the top-level (for HLS) function for the Real FFT frontend processing
// It takes in a stream of real data samples, creates a sliding window (1/2
// old + 1/2 new data) and applies a Hamming windowing function to it before
// packing pairs of samples into a complex format to stream to an XFFT IP Core
// of N/2 points.  This tutorial version takes 16-bit data assumed to be
// in a normalize fixed point format (1 whole bit and 15 fractional bits)
// and outputs 16-bit scaled (i.e. also normalized) complex spectral data
